### Clash-Resistant Timetable for Medical College Phases

**1. Overview of the Scheduling System**  
This project involves creating a schedule for the four distinct phases of a medical college curriculum. The system is designed to allow the college authority to select subjects and assign teachers for each phase. Additionally, the schedule is dynamic and enables the authority to edit subject assignments as required.

**2. Flexibility in Subject and Teacher Selection**  
- Authorities can assign specific teachers to different subjects and phases.  
- Modifications to the selected subjects and teacher assignments can be made seamlessly, providing adaptability in schedule management.

**3. Addressing Teacher Clashes Across Phases**  
- Since there are four different phases, the same teacher might be assigned to teach different subjects in separate batches simultaneously.  
- To prevent this, the timetable is designed to be **clash-resistant**.  
- A **pop-up alert** will appear if the same teacher is scheduled to teach in different phases at the same time, ensuring conflicts are resolved before finalizing the schedule.

**4. Managing Teacher Absences**  
- The system accounts for unexpected teacher absences.  
- When a teacher is marked absent for a particular day, the system will automatically appoint an **alternate teacher** who is available during that period and does not have any other teaching commitments.  
- This ensures uninterrupted learning for students without manual intervention.  

**5. User-Friendly Features**  
- **Dynamic and Editable Schedule**: Authorities can make changes to the timetable anytime.  
- **Conflict Detection**: Prevents overlapping assignments for teachers across different phases.  
- **Automatic Substitute Assignment**: Efficiently reassigns classes during teacher absences.  
- **Dark Mode Option**: Users can enable **dark mode** through a simple toggle option, enhancing accessibility and providing a comfortable viewing experience, especially in low-light environments.

This comprehensive scheduling system is designed to provide a smooth and efficient way to manage the medical collegeâ€™s timetable, ensuring effective learning and resource utilization.
